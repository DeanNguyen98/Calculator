<h1>Project</h1>

<p> This project is a part of The Odin Project Curriculum. It's the final assignment for their Foundation Course. Hence this is the biggest project I've made out of the three(Rock ,Paper, Scissors game and Etch-a-sketch)

<br>

<h1>Method</h1>

<p> The calculator is created by separating each function of the calculator into separate functions, which are appendNumber(), chooseOperator(), compute(), clear(), deleteNum() and updateDisplay(). <p>

<p> By creating this, I've learned to plan out the steps that I need to take to complete a task, and slowly solving smaller subproblems before tackling the big one.</p>
